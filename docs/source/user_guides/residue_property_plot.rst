Residue Property Plot
=====================

4. Create interactive plot of containing the following residue level properties:
    * root mean squared fluctuation (RMSF)
    * torsional flexibility (circular standard deviation of backbone dihedral angles)
    * Secondary structure
    * Solvent accessible surface area
    * Mean and standard deviation for the total surface     electrostatic potential per residue
    * Mean and standard deviation for the mean surface electrostatic potential per residue


.. note:: the paths in the input toml file is relative to the location where the md_davis command will be called from. To avoid any confusion try using absolute paths.
